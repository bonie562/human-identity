Bimbeat is an emotion-based music streaming platform built for the young, tech-savvy, and deeply connected. It’s playful, refreshing, and knows how you feel even when you don’t.

By learning from your past searches and tapping into what others with your vibe are listening to, Bimbeat doesn’t just recommend songs — it curates your emotional soundtrack in real time. Whether you're floating, focused, in love, or in your feelings, Bimbeat finds the rhythm that matches your mood.

The name Bimbeat was chosen cause it had a rhythm to it like a pulse. So naturally, a symbol that felt just as clean, catchy, and easy to spot was needed.

That’s where the “B” mark came in. It’s simple, bold, and instantly recognizable — the kind of symbol you remember after seeing it once. Nothing too complicated. Just a smooth, confident shape that echoes the name and the beat behind it.

It’s the kind of logo that looks good on your screen, your playlist, or even as a little sticker on your laptop. Just like the brand, it’s light, modern, and made to vibe.

In Africa, diversity is both a gift and a challenge.
With thousands of ethnic groups, languages, symbols, and traditions, what feels meaningful to one community can feel foreign or even offensive to another. A color, a name, or a symbol that carries pride in one region might carry pain in another.

That was the challenge at the heart of Loca:
How do you build a brand that belongs to everyone without erasing anyone?

We saw the challenge clearly when exploring names. A word like “Otta” means friend in one language, but enemy in another. What’s warm to one group might trigger discomfort in another. That tension made one thing clear  we couldn’t just pick a name that sounded African.
We needed a name that felt open, neutral, and welcoming across borders.

“Loca” was the answer.
It blends the familiarity of “local” with a soft, rhythmic feel. It’s simple, warm, and intentionally untethered not rooted in one tribe, but resonant across many. It feels human. It feels like home.

But naming was only the first step, when it came to visual design, we had to be just as intentional. African colors are powerful  but they’re also loaded with regional meaning. So we chose a palette that walks a delicate line:

Light green for growth, freshness, and approachability.

Dark green for trust, stability, and groundedness.

Yellow to spark energy, playfulness, and warmth a nod to joy and openness, without the intensity of red or orange, which hold different meanings across cultures.


Together, these colors balance tradition and modernity, seriousness and fun making the brand feel trustworthy, but never stiff.

The logo system follows the same philosophy.
It starts with a circle  a form found in many African visual languages, from woven mats to drums to village gatherings. The circle stands for community, wholeness, and continuity. But the Loca circle doesn’t sit still. It opens, stretches, and evolves  reflecting the brand’s mission to adapt, include, and grow.

From that logo came a full brand identity system one that is:

Modular and flexible enough to fit on a street-side agent kiosk or inside a sleek mobile app.

Friendly and scalable, working just as well in a rural village as in a tech hub.

Built with accessibility in mind, using clean typography, high-contrast elements, and a tone of voice that’s simple and human.


We didn’t want Loca to just look inclusive.
We wanted it to feel like home  no matter where home is.

So from the name to the colors to the shape of the logo, every piece of Loca was crafted with one question in mind:
Will this feel like it’s for everyone?

And if the answer wasn’t yes,
we kept designing.

Moving somewhere new can be overwhelming  not just the logistics, but the feeling of being unrooted. For many migrants, the real challenge isn’t getting there it’s settling in, finding your people, and feeling understood.

Rave is a space for that.

It’s a podcast and community where migrants from all walks of life come together to share real stories the funny mix-ups, the awkward firsts, the homesickness, the hustle, the wins, and the slow process of turning a new place into home.

Whether it’s a story about finding your first job, navigating culture shock, or celebrating the little victories, Rave brings those moments to life with warmth, humor, and honesty.

It’s vibrant and chill at the same time  a conversation that feels like catching up with friends who just get it.

MThis one takes me back.

I started designing about four years ago, and like many beginners, I spent hours learning from the best, Will Paterson, Satori Graphics, and The Futur. Their videos were very exciting formme and it fueled my passion for design. 

One of Will Paterson’s design challenges really stuck with me. It sparked this idea:
What if there was an energy drink made just for creatives?
A brand that didn’t just look cool — but felt like it was part of the process. The hustle. The overnighters. The “aha” moments.

Back then, I didn’t have the skill set to bring the vision to life  but I held onto the idea.

Fast forward to now, while putting together my portfolio, I thought: why not bring Creatir back to life with everything I’ve learned?
So here it is just a snippet of what’s coming. A bold, energetic concept made to reflect the creative mind in motion.

The full brand is on the way, and yep  I’ve definitely got the skills now 😎

Big thanks to the creators who sparked the journey.
Creatir is for anyone who's ever stayed up too late chasing an idea.
